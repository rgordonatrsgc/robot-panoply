# A Panoply of Robots

This is a crowd-sourced tale of robot foibles.

For now, your mission to *plan* two robots and *implement* (write code for) one robot.

Please plan one "round-ish" robot (fits within, or does not extend past, the boundary of a circle).

Please plan one "rectangular-ish" robot (fits within the boundaries of a four-sided polygon with four right-angles).

For each robot:

* Make a clear plan (identify input, process, and output).  This can take the form of a sketch on a co-ordinate system, or, a series of rough storyboards.
* It is important that your robot be anchored to the origin â€“ the top left corner, or (0, 0).
* Implement your plan by writing well-organized, human readable code.
